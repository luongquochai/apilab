🗄️ **HTTP Methods:** Request methods define the type of action you are requesting to be performed.

- `GET` - Requests retrieve resource information
- `POST` - The server creates a new entry in a database
- `PUT` - Updates an existing resource
- `PATCH` - Very similar to `PUT` but makes a partial update on a resource
- `DELETE` - Deletes resource or related component
- `HEAD` - Retrieve response headers identical to those of a GET request, but without the response body.
- `CONNECT` - Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource
- `OPTIONS` - Describe the communication options for the target resource
- `TRACE` - Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource
- `<custom>` - Some APIs use custom request methods such as `LIST`. Type in your custom methods.
