# Project Description

This internal application is inspired by the concepts of **Hoppscotch**, **API Dog**, and **Postman**, offering a unique approach to API testing and interaction. 

Key points to note:

- The entire source code is **completely original and proprietary**, with **no usage of open-source code from Hoppscotch, API Dog, or any similar projects**.
- The **UI/UX design** is based on the core ideas of these tools but has been **reimagined and redesigned** uniquely by the developer to suit internal needs.
- This project is intended strictly for **internal use** and is **not distributed or open-sourced publicly**.
- If you require access or have any inquiries regarding this project, **please contact me directly**.
